Guides
==========

> These guides will get you up-and-running quickly, and help you
understand the concepts behind Graphiti.

If you just want to get a feel for Graphiti code and all the
functionality that comes out-of-the box, head to the
[Quickstart]({{site.github.url}}/quickstart). If you want a birds-eye view of Graphiti's
moving pieces, check out [The Lifecycle of a Graphiti
Request]({{site.github.url}}/guides/overview#lifecycle-of-a-graphiti-request)). Or to understand Resources,
Graphiti's core concept, see the [Resource
API]({{site.github.url}}/guides/concepts/resources).

Or to dive into code, check out our sample apps in [Rails](https://github.com/graphiti-api/employee_directory), [Sinatra](https://github.com/graphiti-api/sinatra_example) and [Plain Ruby](https://github.com/graphiti-api/plain_ruby_example).
