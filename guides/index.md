Guides
==========

> These guides will get you up-and-running quickly, and help you
understand the concepts behind Graphiti.

If you just want to get a feel for Graphiti code and all the
functionality that comes out-of-the box, head to the
[Quickstart](/quickstart). If you want a birds-eye view of Graphiti's
moving pieces, check out [The Lifecycle of a Graphiti
Request](/guides/overview/lifecycle). Or to understand Resources,
Graphiti's core concept, see the [Resource
API](/guides/concepts/resources).

But ideally, read everything ðŸ™‚
